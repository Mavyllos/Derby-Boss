# Derby Boss

Derby Boss is a team management application geared directly toward roller derby leagues. It was created as a capstone project for the Galvanize Web Development Immersive Program.

## Why Derby Boss?
Derby Leagues are, by and large, run on a dues based model. The administrators running the leagues are volunteers, doing it out of love for the sport. There are very few free team management resources targeted directly at roller derby leagues.
